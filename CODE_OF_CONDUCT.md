# Contributor Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as members, contributors, and maintainers of this project, pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people.
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community.
- Showing patience and humility when mistakes are made, and offering constructive ways to improve.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces. Examples of representing our project include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainers at [your-email@example.com]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All project maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Project maintainers will follow these guidelines in determining the consequences for any action that violates this Code of Conduct:

1. **Correction**  
   _Impact: Minor and single-time issues._  
   The project team will provide a private, informal notice to the contributor explaining the violation and requesting changes in future behavior. The team may also request a public or private apology.

2. **Warning**  
   _Impact: Repeated or significant issues._  
   The contributor will receive an official warning, along with temporary restrictions on their contributions or participation.

3. **Temporary Ban**  
   _Impact: Serious violations._  
   A temporary ban from the project’s spaces (e.g., issue trackers, pull requests, community channels) may be applied for behavior that does not improve after a warning.

4. **Permanent Ban**  
   _Impact: Egregious violations or repeated offenses._  
   A permanent ban from any interaction within the project’s spaces may be issued.
